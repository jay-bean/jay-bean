### Hello there, I'm Jay Hutts!
##### ___Pronouns: she/her___

##### ðŸŒ±I'm a software engineer with a focus in web developmentðŸŒ± Javascript has been my primary language and focus, but I am also proficient in Python. Currently I have created four full stack web applications. My most recent project, and one that I am really excited about, [Drop In](https://github.com/jay-bean/DropIn) is an AllTrails clone that features skate parks and their locations.

##### When I'm not at my computer you can catch me outdoors doing anything that'll get your blood pumping! I skate, rock climb, enjoy riding motorcycles and hiking with my dogs. I'm also vegan with a passion for animal rights.
