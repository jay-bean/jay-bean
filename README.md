##### I'm a sprouting software engineer with a focus in web development. Javascript has been my primary language and focus, but I am also proficient in Python. Currently I have created four full stack web applications. My most recent project, and one that I am really excited about, Drop In is an AllTrails clone that features skate parks and their locations.

##### On a more personal note, I love anything outdoors that'll get your blood pumping! I skate, rock climb, enjoy riding motorcycles and hiking with my dogs. I'm also vegan with a passion for animal rights.
